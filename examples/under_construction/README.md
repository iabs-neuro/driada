# Under Construction Examples

This folder contains examples that are currently under development or have known issues that need to be resolved before they can be used reliably.

## selectivity_manifold_mapper/

**Status**: Under construction due to multiple issues

**Known Issues**:
- Component selectivity detection not working as expected
- Integration between INTENSE and dimensionality reduction needs refinement
- Manifold quality metrics need adjustment
- Example may produce inconsistent results

**TODO**:
- Fix component selectivity analysis
- Improve integration with visual utilities
- Validate manifold preservation metrics
- Add proper error handling and edge case detection

These examples will be moved back to the main examples folder once the issues are resolved.
