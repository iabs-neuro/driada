# DRIADA INTENSE Interactive Tutorials

Welcome to the DRIADA INTENSE interactive notebook tutorials! These Jupyter notebooks will guide you through using INTENSE for neuronal selectivity analysis.

## ðŸ“š Available Notebooks

### 1. [01_quick_start.ipynb](01_quick_start.ipynb) - Quick Start (5 minutes)
- **Goal**: Get you analyzing neuronal selectivity in 5 minutes
- **You'll learn**:
  - How to generate synthetic neural data
  - Running basic INTENSE analysis
  - Interpreting significance results
  - Creating your first visualizations
- **Perfect for**: First-time users who want immediate results

### 2. [02_understanding_results.ipynb](02_understanding_results.ipynb) - Understanding Results
- **Goal**: Deep understanding of INTENSE outputs and statistics
- **You'll learn**:
  - Navigating the results data structures
  - Understanding statistical measures (MI, p-values, delays)
  - Creating custom visualizations
  - Analyzing temporal dynamics
  - Exporting results for publication
- **Perfect for**: Users who want to fully understand their analysis

### 3. [03_real_data_workflow.ipynb](03_real_data_workflow.ipynb) - Real Data Workflow
- **Goal**: Apply INTENSE to your own neural recordings
- **You'll learn**:
  - Data formatting and preparation
  - Creating Experiment objects from various sources
  - Quality control and validation
  - Advanced analysis workflows
  - Performance optimization for large datasets
- **Perfect for**: Researchers ready to analyze their own data

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have Jupyter installed
pip install jupyter notebook

# Optional: For better notebook experience
pip install jupyterlab
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Navigate to the notebooks directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/driada2/notebooks
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or for JupyterLab:
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Open a notebook** and follow along!

### Important Notes

- These notebooks use relative imports to access DRIADA without installation
- All notebooks are self-contained and use synthetic data
- Run cells in order for best results
- Restart kernel between notebooks to avoid conflicts

## ðŸ“Š What You'll Accomplish

After completing these tutorials, you'll be able to:
- âœ… Run INTENSE analysis on any neural dataset
- âœ… Identify which neurons encode specific behaviors
- âœ… Understand and interpret all statistical outputs
- âœ… Create publication-quality visualizations
- âœ… Handle real-world data challenges
- âœ… Optimize analysis for large-scale datasets

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Start with notebook 01** even if you're experienced
2. **Run all code cells** to see outputs
3. **Experiment with parameters** to understand their effects
4. **Check the examples/ directory** for more advanced use cases
5. **Read docstrings** for detailed function information

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help
