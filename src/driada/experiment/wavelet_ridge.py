def ridges_to_containers(ridges):
    """Convert a list of Ridge objects to RidgeInfoContainer objects.
    
    This function transforms the Ridge objects (which may be JIT-compiled)
    into RidgeInfoContainer objects that use numpy arrays for efficient
    further processing and analysis.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ridges : list of Ridge
        List of Ridge objects to convert. Each ridge should be terminated.
        
    Returns
    -------
    list of RidgeInfoContainer
        List of RidgeInfoContainer objects with the same ridge information
        stored in numpy arrays. Empty list if input is empty.
        
    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If any ridge object lacks required attributes.
    ValueError
        If RidgeInfoContainer initialization fails (e.g., empty ridge data).
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Assuming we have detected ridges
    >>> ridge = Ridge(10, 0.5, 1.0, 0.1)
    >>> ridge.extend(11, 0.8, 1.1, 0.11)
    >>> ridge.terminate()
    >>> containers = ridges_to_containers([ridge])
    >>> len(containers)
    1
    >>> containers[0].max_ampl
    0.8
    
    Notes
    -----
    The function assumes all ridges have been properly terminated before
    conversion. Unterminated ridges may have incomplete attribute data.
