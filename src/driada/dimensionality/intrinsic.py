    """
    Estimate intrinsic dimension using the k-NN algorithm.

    This method estimates the intrinsic dimensionality by analyzing the ratios
    of distances to the k-th and (k-1)-th nearest neighbors. For k=2, this
    is the TWO-NN algorithm [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features), optional
        The input data matrix where rows are samples and columns are features.
        Either data or precomputed_graph must be provided.

    k : int, default=2
        The number of nearest neighbors to consider. k=2 gives the TWO-NN algorithm.
        Higher values can provide more robust estimates.

    graph_method : {'sklearn', 'pynndescent'}, default='sklearn'
        Method to use for nearest neighbor graph construction:
        - 'sklearn': Uses scikit-learn's NearestNeighbors (exact)
        - 'pynndescent': Uses PyNNDescent (approximate, faster for large datasets)
        Only used if data is provided.

    precomputed_graph : tuple of (indices, distances), optional
        Precomputed k-NN graph as a tuple of:
        - indices: array of shape (n_samples, k+1) with neighbor indices
        - distances: array of shape (n_samples, k+1) with neighbor distances
        The first column (index 0) should contain self-references with distance 0.
        Either data or precomputed_graph must be provided.

    Returns
    -------
    d : float
        The estimated intrinsic dimension of the dataset.

    Notes
    -----
    The method is based on the principle that in a d-dimensional manifold,
    the ratio of distances to successive nearest neighbors follows a specific
    distribution that depends on d.

):
    """
    Estimate intrinsic dimension using geodesic distances (De Granata et al. 2016).

    This method estimates the intrinsic dimensionality by analyzing the distribution
    of geodesic distances computed as shortest paths on a k-nearest neighbor graph.
    The method focuses on the behavior of the distance distribution around its maximum.

    Warning
    -------
    This method is sensitive to the k parameter. Small k values (k < 15) often lead
    to underestimation due to disconnected or sparse graphs that poorly approximate
    geodesic distances. For reliable estimates, use k ≥ 15-25, with larger values
    needed for complex manifolds like Swiss rolls or S-curves.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features), optional
        The input data matrix. Either data or graph must be provided.

    graph : sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_samples), optional
        Precomputed graph adjacency matrix with edge weights as distances.
        If provided, data is ignored. Either data or graph must be provided.

    k : int, default=15
        Number of nearest neighbors for graph construction (if data provided).

    mode : {'full', 'fast'}, default='full'
        Computation mode:
        - 'full': Use all pairwise geodesic distances
        - 'fast': Use a random subset (1/factor of points)

    factor : int, default=2
        Subsampling factor for 'fast' mode. Uses n/factor random points.

    dim_step : float, default=0.1
        Step size for dimension grid search. Smaller values give more precise
        estimates but take longer to compute.

    Returns
    -------
    dimension : float
        The estimated intrinsic dimension of the dataset/manifold.
