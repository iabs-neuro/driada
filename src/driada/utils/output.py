"""
Utilities for capturing and displaying stdout output.

This module provides tools for temporarily capturing stdout output during
code execution, useful for testing, logging, or capturing output from
third-party libraries.

class Capturing(list):
    """
    Context manager that captures stdout output into a list.
    
    Temporarily redirects sys.stdout to capture all print statements and
    stdout writes during the context. The captured output is stored as a
    list of lines (strings without newlines).
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    Inherits from list, so captured lines are accessible as list elements.
    
    Returns
    -------
    self : Capturing
        The Capturing instance itself, which is a list of captured lines.
        
    Warnings
    --------
    This class is NOT thread-safe. Using multiple Capturing contexts in
    different threads simultaneously will cause interference. 
    
    Nested usage may have unexpected behavior - inner contexts will restore
    stdout to the outer context's StringIO, not the original stdout.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> with Capturing() as output:
    ...     print("Hello")
    ...     print("World")
    >>> output
    ['Hello', 'World']
    
    >>> # Using with functions that print
    >>> with Capturing() as log:
    ...     some_verbose_function()
    >>> show_output(log)  # Display captured output
    
    Notes
    -----
    Memory usage scales with output size. For very large outputs, consider
    alternative approaches like writing to temporary files.

    """
    Display captured output from Capturing context.
    
    Prints each line from the captured output to stdout. If the output
    is empty, prints a message indicating the log is empty.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    output : list of str
        List of captured output lines, typically from Capturing context.
        Each element should be a string representing one line of output.
        
    Returns
    -------
    None
        
    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If output is None or not a list-like object.
    AttributeError
        If output doesn't support len() or iteration.
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> with Capturing() as log:
    ...     print("Test output")
    >>> show_output(log)
    Test output
    
    >>> show_output([])
    log is empty
    
    >>> show_output(["Line 1", "Line 2"])
    Line 1
    Line 2
    
    Notes
    -----
    This function is designed to work with the output from Capturing
    context manager but can display any list of strings.
