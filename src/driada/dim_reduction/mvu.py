    """Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
    
    MVU learns a low-dimensional representation that preserves local distances
    while maximizing the variance of the embedding. It formulates the problem
    as a semidefinite program (SDP) to find a kernel matrix that respects
    local isometry constraints.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    equation : {'berkley', 'wikipedia'}, default='berkley'
        Formulation variant to use:
        - 'berkley': UC Berkeley formulation with centered embedding constraint
        - 'wikipedia': Standard formulation with trace maximization
    solver : cvxpy.Solver, optional
        CVXPY solver to use. Default is SCS (Splitting Conic Solver).
    solver_tol : float, default=1e-2
        Convergence tolerance for the SDP solver.
    eig_tol : float, default=1e-10
        Tolerance for eigenvalue thresholding. Eigenvalues in (-eig_tol, eig_tol)
        are set to zero to handle numerical errors in the PSD constraint.
    solver_iters : int, default=2500
        Maximum number of solver iterations. Set to None for default solver limit.
    warm_start : bool, default=False
        Whether to use warm start in solver. Useful when solving similar problems
        repeatedly.
    seed : int, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility.
        
    Attributes
    ----------
    neighborhood_graph : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Binary matrix indicating k-nearest neighbor connections.
        
    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If cvxpy is not installed. Install with pip install cvxpy.
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from driada.dim_reduction.mvu import MaximumVarianceUnfolding
    >>> # Generate sample data
    >>> data = np.random.randn(100, 10)
    >>> # Initialize MVU
    >>> mvu = MaximumVarianceUnfolding(equation='berkley', solver_tol=1e-3)
    >>> # Fit and transform to 2D
    >>> embedding = mvu.fit_transform(data, dim=2, k=5)
    >>> print(embedding.shape)
    (100, 2)
    
    Notes
    -----
    Requires cvxpy package for solving the semidefinite program.
    The algorithm can be slow for large datasets due to the SDP formulation.
    The SDP solver may require tuning for different dataset sizes.
