  **CRITICAL BUGS DISCOVERED:**
  🚨 GCMI ent_g produces NEGATIVE joint entropy for near-perfect correlations
  🚨 Violates fundamental theorem H(X,Y) ≥ max(H(X), H(Y))
  🚨 Root cause: Cannot handle near-singular covariance matrices
  🚨 Same bug pattern affects CDC negative CMI issue
  🚨 43 total tests created: 34 pass, 9 xfailed due to GCMI numerical instability
  
  **Files Created:**
  - tests/test_conditional_mi_and_interaction.py (21 tests)
  - tests/test_gcmi_functions.py (30 tests)
  - Comprehensive bug documentation and xfail markers
  
  **✅ COMPLETED:** GCMI numerical instability FIXED (2025-01-11)
  
  **Implementation Checkpoints:**

  - ✅ Fixed ent_g negative entropy for near-singular covariance matrices  
  - ✅ Consolidated regularization pattern across all GCMI functions

  - ✅ Root cause analysis: CDC case mixes different MI estimators causing bias
  - ✅ Documented CDC limitation with proper @pytest.mark.xfail markers
  - ✅ 43 tests pass, 8 xfailed (expected for known limitations)
  
  **Technical Notes:**
  - regularized_cholesky() eliminates code duplication and ensures consistency
  - Uses adaptive regularization: base 1e-12 + condition-based scaling
  - CDC case requires future workaround (chains different estimators)
  - Differential entropy can be negative (unlike discrete entropy)
  
  **Files Modified:**

  - tests/test_gcmi_functions.py (corrected test expectations)
  - tests/test_conditional_mi_and_interaction.py (documented limitations)
  
  **✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-11):** Implement CDC workaround to avoid chain rule bias
  
  **Implementation Checkpoints:**
  - ✅ Replaced biased chain rule with entropy-based approach: I(X;Y|Z) = H(X|Z) - H(X|Y,Z)
  - ✅ Eliminated mixing of incompatible MI estimators in CDC case
  - ✅ Uses consistent entropy estimation with ent_g() and regularized_cholesky()
  - ✅ Added numerical stability tolerance for small estimation noise
  - ✅ All CDC tests now pass and satisfy CMI ≥ 0 constraint
  - ✅ Zero regressions in other conditional MI cases (CCC, CCD, CDD)
  
  **Files Modified:**
  - src/driada/information/info_base.py (lines 608-658)
  - tests/test_conditional_mi_and_interaction.py (removed xfail markers, updated docs)
  
  **Technical Notes:**
  - CDC case now uses theoretically sound entropy-based formula

  - Leverages existing infrastructure for reliability and consistency
  - Production-grade implementation with proper documentation
- [ ] **NEW HIGH PRIORITY: Fix interaction information sign issues**

  - [ ] Fix `test_interaction_information_andgate` - expects positive II for AND gate synergy
  - [ ] Fix `test_interaction_information_unique_information` - expects near-zero II
  - [ ] Fix `test_interaction_information_perfect_synergy` - expects positive II for perfect XOR
  - [ ] Root cause: Interaction information implementation may have sign reversal
  - [ ] Verify theoretical formula: II(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z)
  - [ ] All 6 tests currently marked with @pytest.mark.xfail
  - [ ] Critical for disentanglement analysis which depends on correct II signs
