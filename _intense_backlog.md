  **CRITICAL BUGS DISCOVERED:**
  üö® GCMI ent_g produces NEGATIVE joint entropy for near-perfect correlations
  üö® Violates fundamental theorem H(X,Y) ‚â• max(H(X), H(Y))
  üö® Root cause: Cannot handle near-singular covariance matrices
  üö® Same bug pattern affects CDC negative CMI issue
  üö® 43 total tests created: 34 pass, 9 xfailed due to GCMI numerical instability
  
  **Files Created:**
  - tests/test_conditional_mi_and_interaction.py (21 tests)
  - tests/test_gcmi_functions.py (30 tests)
  - Comprehensive bug documentation and xfail markers

  - [x] Fix `test_interaction_information_unique_information` - expects near-zero II
  - [x] Fix `test_interaction_information_perfect_synergy` - expects positive II for perfect XOR
  - [x] Root cause: Implementation used McGill convention instead of Williams & Beer convention
  - [x] Changed formula from II(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) to II(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y|Z) - I(X;Y)

  **Technical Notes:**
  - Williams & Beer convention: II < 0 = redundancy, II > 0 = synergy
  - McGill convention (old): II > 0 = redundancy, II < 0 = synergy
  - Formula: II = I(X;Y|Z) - I(X;Y) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Z)
